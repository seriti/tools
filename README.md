# Seriti tools library for microframeworks
Library of LAMP stack PHP objects for building applications within any framework

This is a lightweight set of tools which can do just about anything with very few dependancies which are only required  when you access external services like Amazon S3.

They are the result of building applications for 10years in the real world using predominantly shared hosting environments, so you dont need any fancy server hardware or complex configuration. A standard shared hosting account from most IPS's will be just fine.    

They are intended for use with a micro framwework like SLIM. You could also use these tools with full bloat frameworks like Laravel or Symphony or Cake etc... but that kinda defeats the point.

If your head hurts when you go down the rabbit hole with a "full featured" framework then you have come to the right place. These tools enable you to create secure, fast, and easy to maintain applications that don't require specialist tools to debug or speed them up because they are drowning in an endless hierarchy of gazillions of objects.

All you need is a good understanding of MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and minimal Javascript. 

## Sample micro aplication

Please view [Seriti/slim3-skeleton](https://github.com/seriti/slim3-skeleton) Slim v3 Microframework implementation which uses this library to implement a basic application with user access and customisable menus and layout. You can then expand this minimal application with whatever functionality you require.
